# CS-260D
CS 260D Final Project - Applying SAS to text domain

This repository contains the Colab notebooks used to experiment with applying SAS (subsets that maximize expected augmented similarity) to text domain.
It also includes helper files such as a GPT parser for GPT augmentation and translation.
The JSON and CSV files are locally stored copies of the dataset, along with EDA and GPT augmentations, as re-running the process was computationally expensive.
